-   Updates every second.
-   Minimalist graphical user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have a Pascal compiler that supports the `graph` and `dos` units.

### Usage

1. Copy the program code into your Pascal environment.
2. Compile and run the program.

## Program Structure

The program is structured as follows:

-   `hodnota0`: Function for formatting a numerical value to always have at least two digits.
